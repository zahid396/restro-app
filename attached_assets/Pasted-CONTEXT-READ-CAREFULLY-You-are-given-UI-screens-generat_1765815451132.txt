CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY)

You are given UI screens generated from Google Stitch (HTML/CSS static screens). These screens already exist and must NOT be redesigned.

Some additional features have been added beyond the original scope.

Your task is to convert these static screens into a fully functional interactive prototype and frontend logic layer.

DO NOT redesign UI. DO NOT change layouts unless required for logic.

ROLE

You are a senior frontend architect + product engineer.

You specialize in:

Turning static UI into interactive systems

Wiring logic, states, and flows

Creating realistic prototypes that behave like production apps

OBJECTIVE

Add frontend logic, interactions, states, and navigation to the existing Stitch-generated screens so that:

The app feels real

All flows are clickable and testable

Stakeholders can fully experience the product

This is a high‑fidelity functional prototype, not just visuals.

INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE

Multiple HTML screens generated by Google Stitch

Screens may be separate HTML files

UI elements already exist (buttons, cards, lists, modals)

CORE RULES

Reuse existing HTML & CSS

Add JavaScript only for logic

Keep code clean and modular

Use vanilla JS (or minimal framework if needed)

Simulate backend responses with mock JSON

GLOBAL APP LOGIC (MANDATORY)
App Bootstrap

Read tableId from URL (?table=12 or /t/12)

Store tableId in sessionStorage

Load language preference (default Bangla)

Initialize global state

state = {
  tableId,
  language,
  menu: [],
  cart: [],
  order: null,
  ui: {}
}
SCREEN‑BY‑SCREEN LOGIC
1. Menu Home Screen
Logic

Load menu JSON

Render categories & items dynamically

Apply:

Mood filter

Time‑based priority

Taste tag filters

Interactions

Clicking dish card → open Dish Detail screen/modal

Quick add (+) → add item to cart

Language switch → re-render content

2. Dish Detail Screen
Logic

Receive itemId

Load item details from menu state

Interactions

Quantity change updates subtotal

Add to cart button:

Push item into cart

Trigger combo suggestion logic

AR button:

Open model-viewer if available

Fallback message if not

3. Smart Combo Suggestion
Logic

When item added:

Check predefined combo rules

Suggest relevant add-ons

UI

Show bottom sheet

One-tap add

Dismiss option

4. Cart Screen
Logic

Render cart items from state

Update total dynamically

Handle quantity change & removal

Interactions

Proceed to checkout

Split bill trigger

5. Bill Splitting
Logic

Modes:

Equal split

Item-based split

Calculate per-user totals

Validate sum === total

6. Checkout & Payment
Logic

Select payment method

If Cash:

Set order.payment = 'cash'

If Digital:

Simulate payment success

Create order object

order = {
  id,
  tableId,
  items,
  paymentMethod,
  status: 'received'
}
7. Live Order Status
Logic

Simulate WebSocket using timers

Auto transition:

received → cooking → almost_ready → delivered

UI

Progress animation

ETA updates

8. One‑Tap Reorder
Logic

Save last order in localStorage

Reorder button loads previous cart

Handle unavailable items gracefully.

9. Mini Games & Rewards
Logic

Random reward generator

Probability-based selection

UI

Modal game

Reward reveal animation

10. Feedback & Rating
Logic

Enable only after delivery

Store feedback locally or mock submit

NAVIGATION & PROTOTYPING
Requirements

All buttons clickable

Back navigation works

Modals open/close smoothly

No dead ends

Implementation

Use JS router or simple screen toggling

Maintain navigation history

MOCK DATA STRUCTURE

Provide mock JSON for:

Menu

Combos

Rewards

Order status timing

OUTPUT EXPECTATION

Produce:

JS logic files

State management structure

Event bindings per screen

Mock data

Clear comments

The final result must feel like a real restaurant app demo.

FINAL CHECK

No UI redesign

All features interactive

All flows testable

Mobile‑friendly
